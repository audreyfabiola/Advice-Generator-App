## My process

I first initiated the challenge by creating the HTML structure to define the content and layout of the webpage. Then. I worked on the CSS stylesheets to match the visualization and layout of the webpage according to the requirements of the challenge. Lastly, I worked on the JS to manipulate the button functions and generate advices according to the challenge.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I was able to recall the HTML, CSS, and JS lessons that I had previously studied in the HCI course in semester 1.

### Continued development

I will use the lessons recalled for my future project during the WADS course.
